## Description

An API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list.

- What was your motivation?

My motivation for creating this project was to build an API that could be used in future development, if I were to decide that I wanted to create a social network application. Already, having the API built could mean that I would simply need to build the front-end.

- What did you learn?

I learned how to create an API utilizing the non-relational database technology MongoDB and combine that with my prior knowledge of the MVC paradigm.

## Installation

Please follow these seven steps to install the social network API on your local computer.

-Step 1: Go to the [Social Network API](https://github.com/AlexandertheGreat491/Social-Network-API.git) public repository and 
fork the repository and then utlize the `git clone` command in your terminal to clone the repository.

-Step 2: Open the folder where the project is saved on your local computer in your code editor and open an integrated terminal.

-Step 3: Run the command `npm i` to install the required libraries.

-Step 4: Make sure to create a .gitignore file and include the node_modules.

-Step 5: Connect to the server by running the command `npm start`.

-Step 6: Alternatively, to run the server and not have to restart it every time you make a change to the project, install nodemon by running the command `npm i nodemon`.

-Step 7: By this step the project will be installed on your local computer.
